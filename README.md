# People and Money - Days

_People and Money - Days_ is a simple add-on for the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) web browser that converts absences in the University of Edinburgh's People and Money system from hours into days.

It takes your total number of hours for leave and divides the total by 7 to show how many days of annual leave you have remaining for the year.
